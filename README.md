README
========================

Hello! Thanks for considering an use of my python cowsay!  

Also, I'd like to say that this project is only a project made to me learn and practice python, it's not an official port, only a very, very silly project :)

## **To run it on Windows:**    

Firstly download Python on https://www.python.org/downloads/ , it's *essential* to run this project.  
  
1. Running by file explorer.  

When you download this, open in the File Explorer the folder where `python-cowsay.py` is located.  
  
Double-click the `python-cowsay.py`, and, if a pop-up appears asking which app would you want to open the file, select "Python".    
  
Now, enjoy your python-cowsay!

2. Running by terminal (cmd / Powershell)

Navigate into where you have downloaded the python cowsay by using cd `C:\(The path where you have downloaded this file!)  `
  
Run `python3 python-cowsay.py` or, if it fails, run `python python-cowsay.py` instead.  

Enjoy your python-cowsay!  

## **To run it on Linux**  
  
> Please note that the original cowsay is natively available on Linux, so, this is kinda useless on linux. You might want download this for fun or to see the python code.

Firstly download Python if you haven't installed it already!  

- To download Python on **Debian** based distros, *(like Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Kali, ZorinOS, etc.),* run `sudo apt install python3` on your terminal.  
  
- To download Python on **Fedora** based distros, *(like Fedora, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, AlmaLinux, etc.),* run `sudo dnf install python3` on your terminal.  

- To download Python on **Arch** based distros, *(like Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, etc.),* run `sudo pacman -S python` on your terminal.  
  
Now, navigate into the folder that you have downloaded the python file by using `cd /(Where you have downloaded your file)/`  

If you have navigated to the folder that have the `python-cowsay.py` file, run `python3 python-cowsay.py`or, if it fails, run `python python-cowsay.py` instead.  
  
Enjoy your python-cowsay!  
  
  
### Additional notes:

I can't provide support by now as I'm only a begginer progammer, but I'd love to hear some feedback.  
Also, I'd like to say that all of the credit goes to Tony Monroe, not to me. He created this project and deservers the credit, I've only rewritten this on Python!
